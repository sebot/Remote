# Remote

a Plugin to manage any number of Sites remotely from a single WP Site.

At this time the Plugin supports setting theme options of remote sites using [fetcher theme](https://github.com/sebot/fetcher/). You can hide header, navigation, featured images, sliders and create your entire pages and posts* or menus* remotely without ever logging in to your WordPress site.

## Licensing
    The plugin is opensource and free to use for anyone on personal or non-profit projects as well as commercial ones. However if you consider using the Plugin for any commercial Projects it would be great if you contribute to further developments of the Plugin by funding me.  

    You may **not** sell the Plugin as yours.
